Offload HTTP requests from Sidekiq workers to a dedicated async I/O processor, freeing worker threads immediately.

## Architecture

The gem uses two key classes for handling async HTTP requests:

- **Request**: Contains HTTP-specific parameters (method, URL, headers, body, timeout)
- **RequestTask**: Wraps a Request with callback and job context needed for async processing (job ID, worker classes, timing information)

The Processor accepts `RequestTask` objects via its `enqueue` method, executes the HTTP request asynchronously, and invokes success or error callback workers with the results.

## Usage
